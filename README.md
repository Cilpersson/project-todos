# What is this

My first Redux project during the Technigo bootcamp.
Assignment: **Build a todo app using Redux**.

## How I started

After I had done the code-a-long video with Damien I watched Vans todo code-a-long and tried to do as much as possible for each step by myself before I continued to watch and see how he solved it. Without both of the code-a-longs it would have been a lot tricker for me to get started. I'm really grateful that there where so many videos provided this week üôå

### What I struggled with and should improve for next weeks project

I'm not sure if I struggled with anything specific during the week. I did struggle with feeling a bit lost from time to time but by doing almost all stretch goals (I did not add categories but that's about it) I started to get a hang of redux.

### What I'm proud of

I'm proud that I styled like a mad man! But it was so much fun, I used styled components and also learned about border-image. It's pretty responsive, down to 285px or something at least. I'm proud and happy that I understand Redux a lot better now than before the online meet-up because I felt so lost then.

Oh, I'm also proud that I fixed localStorage by myself (with the help of youtube), not to mention dates and buttons to display completed or active tasks.

## If I had more time

I have more time, but I'm done. Done and very proud of what I have accomplished üèÜ
